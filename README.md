The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. The libposix implements a subset of the POSIX threading API with the hyperC RTOS API. With the libposix, an existing POSIX threading compliant application can be ported to run on the hyperC RTOS. Additionally, a library designed for use with POSIX threading compatible operating systems can be ported to the hyperC kernel based applications.
